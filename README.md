# JumboTM helper user scripts

I have asked often about my TamperMonkey scripts and could I share them. In the past I have ot dos eso as they where not stable, but things have changed.

There is now [on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisjoyce911/JumboTM) for easy access.

## What user scripts do you have:

  * OmniSign-Up.user.js
  * CardPayment.user.js
  * BankWithdraw.user.js
  * Planner.user.js
 
#### OmniSign-Up.user.js
Offers user for all Jumbo sites , it allows for the different registeration forms.

**todo**
* Improve sample data managment
* Add a selection option for country
* Get DE postcode working
 
#### CardPayment.user.js
A quick way to fill out a Credit card, it has test cards for ComWeb

#### BankWithdraw.user.js
Fake bank account with SWIFT codes, for some fun look at the account name and aditional instrucations.

**todo**
* Add more BIS's 
* Add more Accounts
* Allow for current users locate for Bank/account format
   
####  Planner.user.js
Sick of filling in your time log enteries ?
 
## Install

Tampermonkey : http://tampermonkey.net/ (I have tested them using Crome & Safari , Iâ€™ll give Firefox a go sometime)

Install scripts , just open them in your browser , TM should open and you get asked to Save/Install

[See the doc's](http://tampermonkey.net/faq.php?ext=dhdg#Q102) or just cluck on the link below

* [BankWithdraw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisjoyce911/JumboTM/master/BankWithdraw.user.js)
* [CardPayment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisjoyce911/JumboTM/master/CardPayment.user.js)
* [OmniSign-Up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisjoyce911/JumboTM/master/OmniSign-Up.user.js)

## Updating

The easy way : [See the doc's](http://tampermonkey.net/faq.php?ext=dhdg#Q101)

In Tampermonkey , Dashboard / Settings / Script Update / Set to something ( Same for External)

When I update them they should auto-update , but you can do a manual update from the TM menu


Have fun :+1:
